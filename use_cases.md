Successful Case (Happy Path):
Input: "Can you get me the details for todo item number 5?"
Desired Output: "The todo item with ID 5 has the title "laboriosam mollitia et enim quasi adipisci quia provident illum" and is not completed.\nTERMINATE"

Another Successful Case (Different ID):
Input: "Fetch todo 1"
Desired Output: (The corresponding title and completion status for ID 1) + TERMINATE

API Error Case (e.g., Not Found):
Input: "I need info on todo 999888"
Desired Output: Something like (depending on your tool's error formatting and LLM's interpretation): "The tool reported an error: HTTP error: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/999888. Response: {}...\nTERMINATE" (Tailor this to what your agent actually says).

Tool Input Validation Error Case:
Input: "What about todo number 0?" (or "Can you get todo abc?")
Desired Output: Something like: "The tool reported an error: Invalid todo_id. Must be a positive integer.\nTERMINATE"
